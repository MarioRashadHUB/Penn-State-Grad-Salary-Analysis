COMPANY DESCRIPTION

Willie’s Superbrew is a hard seltzer blended with real fruit. It’s gluten free and low in carbs and calories, but we brew with thousands of pounds of real fruits and spices, meaning it’s bursting with real flavor. It’s a drink as unique and refreshing as its origin story. Because after all, there aren’t many places where a goat farmer and a young neuroscientist would meet, but apparently a beach on the Cape is one. Willie shared his ginger brew, and they started selling it at farmers’ markets. The rest is history.

We are a team with heart and hustle unified by a dream to make alcohol better and our belief in 5 values:
Foster Growth
No B.S
Have a Soul
Be Curious and Innovate
Live Responsibly
JOB DESCRIPTION

We are bringing real ingredients + transparency to alcohol, and we're doing it with soul. We are looking for passionate, enthusiastic and all around awesome people to join our small team and be part of directly growing a small start-up as we grow Superbrew across the Northeast.

Supercrew Requirements
Available on a weekly basis in the following time frames: TH 4-7pm, F 4-7pm, S 1-7pm, Su 1-7pm for at least 2 hours
Mature, dependable, and able to work unsupervised
Comfortable being on your feet for a long period of time
Access to dependable transportation with a valid driver’s license
Passionate and enthusiastic about Willie’s Superbrew
Have great communication and people skills.
Be able to educate others
21+
What Does the Supercrew Do?
As a Brand Ambassador, you will represent Willie’s at customer-facing events such as Grocery & Liquor Store Samplings, Bars & Restaurant Promotions, Brewfests, Local Events, and more. Your main job will be to educate new customers on what Willie’s is and why it’s so great by getting as many people as possible to try it.

One of the purposes of this program is to be a direct pipeline for long-term hires. That being said, interest in long-term employment is not a requirement by any means. Our goal is to empower everyone within this program to be a part of bringing real ingredients to alcohol! We know that success is more than just numbers, and we want to make sure you grow and have fun just as much as we want you to do well at tastings. We’re a tightknit team here, so while everyone works hard on their own, we like to get together and balance it out with some fun, too. We will always welcome and solicit suggestions, ideas, & feedback and you will have the opportunity to individually pursue new ideas to grow and spread Willie’s.

Tasting & Event Responsibilities
Most of your responsibilities with Super Crew will be tastings at different liquor & grocery stores in your region. Tastings are an opportunity to educate and directly sell to new consumers and create excitement about the Superbrew Brand. We also sponsor a number of events around the region which are organized by companies, nonprofits & orgs with similar values to our own. These are a variety of events throughout the year and no two are the same!

At both tastings and events, your responsibilities include:
Represent Willie’s Superbrew at an account - this may be a customers first & only interaction with the brand, so we need to make sure it’s a great one!
Arrive on time with ample product/materials, greet managers/organizers, and set up for scheduled tasting time
Serve customers samples of the brews & educate them on Superbrew
Be responsible for ensuring you always have enough product, sample cups & promo material by coordinating with Ellen & the office team
Follow up each tasting/event with feedback about your experience with accounts, tastings & customers
Inputting your desired availabilities at least 2 weeks in advance so we can schedule you accordingly
Scheduling
Scheduling is flexible. We can work around your schedule. That being said, most tastings will occur between the following timeframes:
Thursdays 4-7pm
Fridays 4-8pm
Saturdays 1-7pm
Sundays 1-7pmTastings are generally between 2-4 hours. We’ve found that SuperCrew members that are in our program the longest do at least 1 tasting per week . Our most successful SuperCrew members do 2+ tastings per week.
There are two main types of events where you would represent Willie’s Superbrew - at Direct Selling Events and Other Events.

See below for a breakdown of our current structure:
Event Type: Direct Selling (ie. grocery & liquor store tastings)
Frequency: 90% of current openings
Compensation Structure: $15/hr + mileage compensation + bonus incentives
Event Type: Other Events (ie. sponsored promotional events, brewfests, local events, etc.)

Company Description
When people think of solar they usually think of rooftop systems that might be installed on
their neighbor’s homes. But there is a more exciting yet lesser known market segment
emerging called community solar. Community solar allows everyone to participate and benefit
from the expansion solar energy. It is the embodiment of the concept of environmental justice:
the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national
origin, or income.
Early on Solar On Earth recognized the importance of community solar and we are now looked
upon as the go-to company in the field by most of the major solar farm developers.
The concept of community is simple: allow everyone to go green by subscribing to a solar farm.
There is no need to install anything on your roof or give control of your roof to a big
corporation for 20 years. There is no upfront investment required, and in most cases, if you
grow tired of saving money, you can terminate your subscription with incurring a termination
fee.

Solar On Earth is currently leading the way in customer acquisition in two of the leading states
for community solar: Massachusetts and New York. But we don’t plan to stop there. We are
currently building the foundation to move into other states where community solar is emerging
including Maryland, New Jersey, and Illinois. That goal can’t be accomplished without a
committed professionally trained sales organization that shares our vision and goals.
Some on the outside might look at what we do and think: I don’t want to do door-to-door.

On the front lines of every successful company is a sales team who are
engaging with prospective customers and evangelizing that company’s products. Door to Door prospecting is an
excellent place to learn the sales craft, understand how businesses function and act as a stepping-
stone for any entrepreneur. Door-to-door may be the best classroom there is because
the skills you learn here can help you succeed in most any environment in the future.

The Solar On Earth team is passionate about what we do because it not only champions a
cleaner environment, it allows everyone to participate and benefit from the expansion of
renewable energy.",-1,SOLAR ON EARTH,"Burlington, MA","Ayer, MA",1 to 50 employees,2015,Company - Private,Energy,"Oil, Gas, Energy & Utilities",Unknown / Non-Applicable,-1

EVP - Brand Purpose & Reputation,$7-$10 Per Hour(Glassdoor est.),"Businesses are experiencing a tremendous shift in the expectations and complexities when it comes to brand purpose and overall reputation management. While much of it is driven by the current social and political environment, it is equally driven by the ever expanding and powerful voice of the employee.
Couple that with a customer population that is more socially conscious than ever, and you have an ever-evolving landscape to manage. It is no longer acceptable for Brands to simply sell their goods and services. They are required to take a stand on issues that are important to their business/people, advocate for policy change at the local, federal and global level and roll up their sleeves to drive real change through impactful programs and funding.
And if you are not, as a Brand, communicating out about your company’s position, then you are considered to be doing nothing. There is an expectation that you will not only participate, but you will be transparent, active and engage in a public dialog. This presents both challenges for brands AND opportunities. We see the opportunity in helping companies successfully navigate both. We believe companies need to both ADVANCE and DEFEND their brands through Brand Purpose and Reputation programs and campaigns that articulate not only their mission- but their Purpose.
We see the critical components that sit at the center of Brand Purpose & Reputation as Executive Communications, Employee Engagement, Financial Communications, Crisis Communications, Public Affairs and Purpose.
Our goal is to create a compelling offering around Brand Purpose and Reputation for our current and prospective clients. To do this, we need to build out our go forward approach and a team that can scale the needs brands have today in the current climate. The work we do today in the disciplines that make this up (CEO Comms, Crisis, Employee Engagement, PA, Finance, Purpose) is strong. That said, we are limited geographically and we have the opportunity to expand our bench of experts.
We are looking for a leader to:
Be a client counselor on navigating the complex dynamics facing brands today (how to put purpose at the center of a brand story; how to activate your approach in substantive ways, etc.)
Devise a Brand Purpose and Reputation go to market approach (positioning, up level awareness of our capabilities, reach new client prospects, etc.)
Experience and understanding of digital and social strategies, in particular in areas of issues and crisis management
Expand our footprint through smart partner strategies and strengthening our offering in key markets in the US (SF & NY) and Globally
Grow our team of experts

Agency and Team Leadership
Envision and build WE's Brand Purpose and Reputation business – from the development of a 3-year strategy plan, to the build-out of the collective services, team/skillsets and growth paths (partnerships, acquisitions, etc.).

Act as an ambassador for the agency in public forums and networking opportunities to increase awareness of our capabilities and raise our profile in the brand purpose and reputation space.
Maintain an active industry presence and stay current on market position, competitive set and future of communications.
Develop a differentiated and relevant point-of-view – about communications and technology trends – that aligns to our brand and resonates globally. Effectively communicate our perspective with our global teams, clients and the industry through owned and earned channels.
Cultivate relationships with range of influencers, from media, developers and analysts to enthusiasts, in order to develop a strong understanding of the landscape and a unique point-of-view regarding how clients can best engage these audiences.
Client and Business Management

Foster on-going, valuable relationships with influencers, serving as a critical connection between thought leaders, advocacy groups and client stakeholders.
Demonstrate deep understanding of a range of societal and public policy issues effecting Fortune 500 brands, particularly in WE’s chosen sectors of Technology, Consumer and Healthcare.
Infuse a data-driven approach to strategic communications planning and messaging to enable clients to act swiftly in dynamic environments.
Advise on strategic communications proposals to advance and defend a client’s brand identity, improve corporate reputation, broaden awareness of its programs and commitments, and tell a cohesive global story across multiple audiences.

Actively involved in all aspects of P&L ownership including account profitability, account health, client service and billing, and team success.
Other duties as assigned.

Bachelor’s degree in Communications, Public Relations, Public Policy or similar applicable field is preferred
At least 15 to 20 years of experience in Public Relations/Public Affairs – in an agency and/or corporate environment.
Deep understanding of wide range of communications channels, tools and vehicles spanning paid, owned and earned platforms, including social platforms.

Associate Brand Manager- Josh Cellars,$7-$10 Per Hour(Glassdoor est.),"WOULD YOU LIKE TO HELP TURN ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING AND MOST DISRUPTIVE WINE BRANDS INTO A TRUE ICON OF THE BEVERAGE BUSINESS?

DEUTSCH FAMILY WINE& SPIRITS IN STAMFORD, CT IS CURRENTLY SEEKING AN ASSOCIATE BRAND MANAGER TO WORK ON ITS INDUSTRY LEADING JOSH CELLARS WINE BRAND.

A BRAND DISRUPTING AN INDUSTRY

The 2015 Wine Brand of the Year per Market watch magazine, Josh Cellars has seen tremendous growth and has become the largest wine brand over $10 a bottle in the world.

Josh was the single largest contributor to total wine sales from 2016-2019, and the brand’s growth trajectory isn’t slowing. Josh is achieving industry leading gains in household penetration and consumer meaning and uniqueness each year. The brand is unique as it is one of the few premium brands that holds leadership positions both in volume share and volume growth across all major wine varietals, from its #1 selling 1.5 million case premium Cabernet Sauvignon to its #1 domestic Rosé over $10.

A BRAND WITH ICONIC POTENTIAL

In a category where packaging is the key consumer touch point, Josh Cellars’ scripted text logo and its antique parchment label design is simple and elegant, making the brand look much more premium than its shelf price of $10-$15.

The liquid also consistently overdelivers in terms of quality. Josh Cellars wines deliver rich and expressive flavors but remain accessible to more novice wine drinkers. Not only does the brand look like a more premium wine, it tastes like one as well. In 2019 alone, the brand’s base wines have received three 90-point scores from leading Wine publications.

The brand also features an authentic and inspiring founder’s story, rooted in gratitude, community and classic American values, and leverages an engaging and authentic brand founder to connect in deeper, more personal ways with consumers.

A BRAND WITH A THOUGHT LEADING APPROACH TO MARKETING

Josh Cellars’ approach to marketing has resulted in the brand delivering the most creatively effective and intelligently deployed marketing in the wine industry. From the top-testing advertising campaign in wine to the first wine brand to ever sell and sample in a Grand Central Station pop up experience; Josh Cellars is proving itself to be a brand with a consumer-centric and innovative approach to driving brand meaning.

"Service Ambassador, Client Support",$7-$14 Per Hour(Glassdoor est.),"Arteriors is a team of smart, imaginative (and sometimes quirky) people who embody loyalty to our customers, our brand and each other. We’ve stripped away the red tape and provide an environment which thrives on new ideas brought into fruition.
As a Service Ambassador, you’ll act as a liaison between our clients and Arteriors by supporting client inquiries. You’ll be the first point of contact for the client and will assist with and resolve any issues that arise. To land this gig, you’ll need a High School Diploma or equivalent. You’ll also need to have experience in a customer support role that required both phone and email support.

You enjoy helping people. You get a thrill out of leading people in the right direction.
You are calm and collected under pressure. You think on your feet while ensuring the best possible level of service.
You are motivated and driven. You appreciate a challenge and thrive in environments that allow you to make decisions that impact the bottom line.
You communicate clearly. You write well and can explain just about anything to anyone. You have no problem with communicating in writing and on the phone.
You think, ‘glass half full’. You maintain a positive outlook, even in the most difficult situations, and encourage others to do the same.
You believe in personal accountability. You see the value in both, giving and receiving, constructive feedback and you often seek new opportunities to improve and develop your skills.
