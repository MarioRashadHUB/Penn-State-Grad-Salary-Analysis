* Scraped over 7000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from each glassdoor job description to quantify and observe the value companies put on excel, powerpoint, microsoft office, analytics, photoshop, adobe, and adwords.

## Code and Resources Used

## Data
Tweaked the web scraper github repo (above) to scrape 7000 job postings from glassdoor.com. With each job, I got the following:
*	Job title
*	Salary Estimate
*	Job Description
*	Rating
*	Company 
*	Location
*	Company Headquarters 
*	Company Size
*	Company Founded Date
*	Type of Ownership 
*	Industry
*	Sector
*	Revenue
*	Competitors 

## Data Cleaning
The following changes were made and created the following variables before I could preform my analysis:

*	Parsed numeric data out of salary 
*	Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages 
*	Removed rows without salary 
*	Parsed rating out of company text 
*	Made a new column for company state 
*	Added a column for if the job was at the companyâ€™s headquarters 
*	Transformed founded date into age of company 
*	Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:
    * Excel  
    * Powerpoint  
    * Microsoft Office  
    * Analytics  
    * Photoshop
    * Adobe
    * Adwords
*	Column for simplified job title
*	Column for description length 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are one of the highlights.
