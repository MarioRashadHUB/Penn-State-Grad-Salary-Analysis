Website Designer/Developer,$40K-$47K (Glassdoor est.),"Company Description

KWSM is a full service digital marketing agency made up of journalists. We specialize in website development & SEO, social media strategy & management, content creation, PR & influencer marketing, and digital advertising. Clients hire us to create integrated digital marketing strategies to generate leads or sales. Half our clients are B2B and half are B2C.

We have offices in Orange County, CA, San Diego, CA, Atlanta, GA and Las Vegas, NV.

Job Description

We are looking for a website designer/developer to create new websites, and refresh existing websites, for our clients. We are a digital marketing agency that believes that social media and digital ads work best when we can drive traffic to a highly-functional hub. There is no reason for a company to invest in a digital strategy if their website is outdated. You will work with our Content Editors to create an outstanding online presence for each of our clients, ensuring that their website and social media channels are working together.

We're looking for someone who truly wants to be part of our team. We're building something amazing, and need your ideas and talent to take our website program to the next level.

You will need to be familiar with Wordpress, Google web tools, and have a basic understanding of the major social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube). The ability to work on non-wordpress sites is also a plus. Throw in some graphic design skills, and we would be pretty excited about you.

We are looking for someone innovative and creative. We expect our web designers to have design capabilities in addition to the ability to simply build out a website. You must be able to listen to a client's goals and ideas, and create a website that exceeds their expectations.

We value efficiency and the ability to juggle several projects at once. At any given time, we are working with several clients simultaneously, and each one of them needs to be treated as a priority. You must be able to prioritize a to-do list and meet deadlines without fail.

This isn't the kind of gig where you can work through a couple of rounds of changes, and be finished with the site. We will continue to tweak a project until the client is thrilled. We're looking for someone who is loyal, patient, and cares deeply about giving clients exactly what they want and need.

The right designer/developer for our team will have a solid understanding of search engine optimization, how social media and websites work together, and best practices for online marketing. We design great looking sites - that work to boost our clients' visibility (and bottom line).

This is a full-time, salaried position with benefits and job security.

We operate on a 9/80 workweek - Fridays off every other week, 9-hour workdays from 7:00 am - 4:30 pm Monday - Thursday.

Qualifications

The right person for this job will be...

Creative.

If creating exceptional websites was easy, anyone could do it. If you have big ideas, are willing to take risks, and want a job where you can be innovative and try new things, KWSM could be a very good fit.

Communicative.

We tell stories for a living. That involves engaging and communicating with an audience online, but it also requires the ability to communicate well with our clients, and each other. We’re a small company, and you will have a lot of opportunity to add your feedback. We need someone who wants to be heard.

Great at Time Management.

Can you take a lengthy ‘to do’ list and prioritize what’s important? Can you multi-task when necessary, while continuing to perform well? Can you thrive in a bustling and interactive environment, and still get your work done? If so, you’ll fit right in!

Team-oriented.

We have a very collaborative office, and want to work with people who want to be part of a team. If you’re the kind of person who likes the door to their office closed, you probably won’t be happy here. (Our offices don’t actually have doors.)

Passionate.

We want to work with people who are passionate. If you have the ability to get excited about something and throw yourself into it, you will find a lot of kindred spirits here.

From strategy through execution, we focus on accuracy, transparency, and scientific value to create programs that are evidence-based, clinically relevant, and contribute to the development of our clients’ brands. Over a third of our staff hold advanced scientific or medical degrees, and most work from where they live.

Summary: The Project Coordinator contributes to the development of many aspects of medical communications initiatives. Depending on the scope and nature of each project, this responsibility can range from managing segments of a project on which a Project Manager is taking a primary lead, to supporting segments of the project in which other team members have responsibility.

Utilize database system (Microsoft Access) for key opinion leader management, mail merges, faculty information requests, and report generation

A Few Signs That The Job Isn't Right for You
Can’t someone else do that?”, “That’s not my responsibility”, and “Why does this depend on me?” are routine parts of your inner dialogue.
You’ve said, “The deadline is tomorrow, but it’s 6:00 PM so it’ll have to wait” and meant it.
You assess someone who lets a deadline slip because they’re working 70 hours per week serving clients as just “not having it all together.”
You often ask questions of others that can be answered with a brief Google search, phone call, or record check.
You believe file versioning and naming conventions are a stupid waste of time.
You think it’s unreasonable when stakeholders expect you to provide information that will give them assurance that tasks are being completed appropriately.
If you don’t know what to do next, you wait. And wait.
You’re more worried about what people think of you than the quality of the outcome you produce.
You resent ambiguous or unstructured situations and require perfect clarity at all times to be happy at work.
Changes to plan, multiple revisions, and new assignments that pop up unexpectedly are unacceptable to you.
You are comfortable letting team members down.

A Few Signs That The Job Isn't Right for You
Can’t someone else do that?”, “That’s not my responsibility”, and “Why does this depend on me?” are routine parts of your inner dialogue.
You’ve said, “The deadline is tomorrow, but it’s 6:00 PM so it’ll have to wait” and meant it.
You assess someone who lets a deadline slip because they’re working 70 hours per week serving clients as just “not having it all together.”
You often ask questions of others that can be answered with a brief Google search, phone call, or record check.
You believe file versioning and naming conventions are a stupid waste of time.
You think it’s unreasonable when stakeholders expect you to provide information that will give them assurance that tasks are being completed appropriately.
If you don’t know what to do next, you wait. And wait.
You’re more worried about what people think of you than the quality of the outcome you produce.
You resent ambiguous or unstructured situations and require perfect clarity at all times to be happy at work.
Changes to plan, multiple revisions, and new assignments that pop up unexpectedly are unacceptable to you.
You are comfortable letting team members down.

We’re out to make the world a safer place by solving big problems and taking on the public safety challenges of our time. From our company's inception building the TASER device to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with the state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities. We’ll put video at the heart of the police record so our justice system can get to the truth faster. And we won't stop innovating until the bullet is rendered obsolete.

It’s a big mission, but it’s one we’ll pursue relentlessly every single day.

Our Product
We are building a new product that will help first responders at the most critical moment – when they’re responding to a call for service. How do we get first responders the right information, at the right time, and in the right format, so that they can arrive at the scene prepared and ready to act? How can we equip them to coordinate with each other and their partners (fire, medical, other neighboring agencies)? The right solution will utilize intelligent mapping and routing, real-time communications, applications of artificial intelligence, and a heavy focus on making industry-leading experiences usable for both for first responders doing 60 MPH in a 35 zone and for dispatchers handling hundreds of calls a day.

A Few Signs That The Job Isn't Right for You
Can’t someone else do that?”, “That’s not my responsibility”, and “Why does this depend on me?” are routine parts of your inner dialogue.
You’ve said, “The deadline is tomorrow, but it’s 6:00 PM so it’ll have to wait” and meant it.
You assess someone who lets a deadline slip because they’re working 70 hours per week serving clients as just “not having it all together.”
You often ask questions of others that can be answered with a brief Google search, phone call, or record check.
You believe file versioning and naming conventions are a stupid waste of time.
You think it’s unreasonable when stakeholders expect you to provide information that will give them assurance that tasks are being completed appropriately.
If you don’t know what to do next, you wait. And wait.
You’re more worried about what people think of you than the quality of the outcome you produce.
You resent ambiguous or unstructured situations and require perfect clarity at all times to be happy at work.
Changes to plan, multiple revisions, and new assignments that pop up unexpectedly are unacceptable to you.
You are comfortable letting team members down.

Senior Product Designer - Real-Time Mobile Communications,$128K-$152K (Glassdoor est.),"Our mission is to protect life.
We’re out to make the world a safer place by solving big problems and taking on the public safety challenges of our time. From our company's inception building the TASER device to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with the state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities. We’ll put video at the heart of the police record so our justice system can get to the truth faster. And we won't stop innovating until the bullet is rendered obsolete.

It’s a big mission, but it’s one we’ll pursue relentlessly every single day.

Our Product
We are building a new product that will help first responders at the most critical moment – when they’re responding to a call for service. How do we get first responders the right information, at the right time, and in the right format, so that they can arrive at the scene prepared and ready to act? How can we equip them to coordinate with each other and their partners (fire, medical, other neighboring agencies)? The right solution will utilize intelligent mapping and routing, real-time communications, applications of artificial intelligence, and a heavy focus on making industry-leading experiences usable for both for first responders doing 60 MPH in a 35 zone and for dispatchers handling hundreds of calls a day.

Two core values, rooted in the name, guide the initiative:

Restoring calls for truth telling and healing, a process by which people most impacted by the justice system are partners in reform; and

Promise acknowledges the failed promise to generations of young people, demands commitment to supporting them in realizing their full potential, and asks us to look forward toward a vision of ending the prison model of justice.

Natural Infrastructure Initiative Overview

The Natural Infrastructure Initiative is an interdisciplinary and cross-programmatic effort to advance nature-based strategies that leverage restoration, protection, and sustainable management of natural and working landscapes and urban green infrastructure, alongside built systems, to provide water and carbon-related services as well as disaster risk strategies and poverty alleviation approaches through the development, implementation and financing of built and nature-based solutions.

With staff in Washington, D.C.

Participants share an aspiration to help reduce deforestation, restore forests and trees, and manage forests more sustainably. Cities4Forests’ goal is to amplify current best practices and extend the deliberate city-forest relationship to the global scale on which cities and forests interact. It is a voluntary coalition involving mayors’ offices— and supported by other subnational agencies such as public water utilities and offices of sustainability—from around the world. Cities4Forests encourages peer-to-peer inspiration and learning, and members receive technical support from institutions with expertise in forests, climate change, water, communications, finance, and policy.

Natural Infrastructure Initiative Overview

The Natural Infrastructure Initiative is an interdisciplinary and cross-programmatic effort to advance nature-based strategies that leverage restoration, protection, and sustainable management of natural and working landscapes and urban green infrastructure, alongside built systems, to provide water and carbon-related services as well as disaster risk strategies and poverty alleviation approaches through the development, implementation and financing of built and nature-based solutions.

With staff in Washington, D.C. (US), Sao Paolo (Brazil) and Mexico City (Mexico), we are catalyzing a global movement to enhance water security and bolster economic development through landscape conservation, restoration and sustainable management. We convene and empower champions at all levels of decision making and provide the best available evidence and guidance to put natural infrastructure strategies into action. In 2019, the Natural Infrastructure Initiative will ramp up the Cities4Forests project to jumpstart our work in cities across the world.

Cities4Forests Overview

Cities4Forests is a cross-programmatic effort – involving WRI’s Water, Forests, and Cities programs – that aims to catalyze political, social, and economic support among city governments and urban residents to integrate inner, nearby, and faraway forests into city development plans and programs. Participants share an aspiration to help reduce deforestation, restore forests and trees, and manage forests more sustainably. Cities4Forests’ goal is to amplify current best practices and extend the deliberate city-forest relationship to the global scale on which cities and forests interact. It is a voluntary coalition involving mayors’ offices— and supported by other subnational agencies such as public water utilities and offices of sustainability—from around the world. Cities4Forests encourages peer-to-peer inspiration and learning, and members receive technical support from institutions with expertise in forests, climate change, water, communications, finance, and policy.

Cities4Forests’ goal is to amplify current best practices and extend the deliberate city-forest relationship to the global scale on which cities and forests interact. It is a voluntary coalition involving mayors’ offices— and supported by other subnational agencies such as public water utilities and offices of sustainability—from around the world. Cities4Forests encourages peer-to-peer inspiration and learning, and members receive technical support from institutions with expertise in forests, climate change, water, communications, finance, and policy.
