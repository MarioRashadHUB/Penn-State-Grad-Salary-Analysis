Vantage Point Retirement Living is a family-owned and -operated organization born out of the belief that seniors deserve more when it comes to senior living. More independence, more caring, more amenities, more opportunities to embrace life and make the most of each day. EOE

While Vantage Point may be considered a family business, its founders, Greg and Rita Stevens, have decades of industry experience behind them – bringing together the best of both worlds to provide area seniors with the most extraordinary retirement living experience possible.

We believe that family-owned is better than publicly traded when it comes to senior living. We’re proud of our roots and our family tree, which consists of team members who’ve been with us decades and a second generation that will carry on our legacy for years to come.

Here, we understand that family bonds are created by more than DNA. Our bonds are formed both by decades-long relationships and first-time handshakes. They’re formed by celebrations of successes and support through loss.

At Vantage Point, we’re family because we share a common belief that a lifestyle community can be more than just a place to live. It’s a place to love, to thrive, to enjoy, to IMPROVE... To celebrate, to laugh, to cry... and to do it all together...

Event Producer & Community Catalyst // AUSTIN,$20K-$45K (Glassdoor est.),"Hello friend. We are Daybreaker, a community of early risers whose mission is to stitch the world back together through dance, self-expression, music and mischief. We are a team of Community Architects, Experience Designers, Artists, Performers, and Mischief Makers — and we create experiences IRL so that we can get back to connecting with one another through all five of our senses, not just two (our phones) — and in the morning when our bodies are the most energetic and awake. With the isolation epidemic our most pressing global problem — that bleeds into every aspect of humanity (when we don't belong, we don't care about the environment, animals, we lack empathy etc.) — we are solving this problem with the most POTENT solution: DANCE. When we bring movement, music, fun, aliveness, play and dance into the conversation, all of a sudden, eradicating isolation begins to feel achievable. Daybreaker is now in 27 cities with a community of 500K+ activated members who wake up at sunrise to dance with reckless abandon, all without substances.

And now, we are launching in ATX and are looking for YOU — the most passionate, creative, curious, and service oriented Community Architect and Experience Designer who is as excited as we are to level their city up and create a space for all ages, all shapes, all genders and sexual orientations to come together, connect and dance.

Daybreaker is a 3-hour experience, typically from 6am to 9am where the first hour is yoga or fitness and the next two hours is a full-on, immersive, performative dance party. Imagine seeing breakdancers, aerialists, fire spinners and dueling violinists — all before going to work.

A few words from our community:

—

""Daybreaker is a SPIRITUAL experience. It's the first dance floor I've truly let go on and have felt years of trauma leave my body. Dancing is medicine and I never understood that until I went to Daybreaker. Thank you for creating such an inclusive, substance-free judgement-free space. I never miss one now.""

""I didn't realize how co-dependent having fun and drinking was for me until I went to Daybreaker and had the best morning of my life, completely sober!

""Dancing is truly the BEST way to stay healthy and active! I probably burn 1000 calories at Daybreaker! I forgot that ""working out"" could actually be FUN!""

""I met my now best friend on the dance floor. We made eye contact on the dance floor, smiled and twirled each other around! It took real courage for me since I usually only get wild when I'm on something. It was SO freeing to meet someone AS ME. Thank you Daybreaker!""

""Daybreaker inspired me to come out to my family. After feeling so included and so free, I had the courage to share with my family who I really am. Thank you for changing my life in such a pivotal way.""

—

This is a critical moment for humanity. We can go in two directions — into a VR headset or into our most present human experience. It's time to shed all the layers and get back to dance. We believe dance is the antidote. Let's make magic.

“My favorite parts of my job are the times I get to create that custom event with an excited guest. That moment they see the vision and they start getting as excited as you are is one of the best parts of the job.” -- Nicholas S., Lead Event Coordinator in Grapevine, TX

“I love how unique my job is. I love event coordinating, but I never wanted to do it in a hotel. I think this is one the best positions I have ever held. The most important aspects of my job are to sell the Main Event experience to both corporate and groups. It takes a very outgoing person to fulfill this role due to the constant client interaction and prospecting.” -- Carly C., Event Coordinator in Pittsburgh, PA

Proposal Writer / BizDev Support (for Web and MarComm Projects),$20K-$45K (Glassdoor est.),"First, a quick blurb about Taoti…

Established in 1996, Taoti Creative is a boutique, full-service creative agency located on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.  We are privately owned and have no corporate overloads (nothing personal, WPP.)  We do stuff like web development, social media management, branding, experiential marketing, video, AR/VR, etc.  Our mission is to ‘move the needle’ for our clients.  We leverage technology, creativity, and innovation to generate meaningful and measurable results for our clients—that’s what drives us.  Speaking of clients, they’re about 60% non-profits, 20% commercial, and 20% federal government.  Some of our customers include World Bank, USAID, DC Water, Discovery Education, American Chemical Society, Jane Goodall Foundation, and dozens of ‘National Association of _____________,’ etc.  Our full-time team of about 50 employees is about 65% in-house and 35% remote.  We hail from over 14 countries.  And for the last four years in a row, we’ve made the Inc5000 list of fastest growing companies in the United States.  There’s of course plenty of additional information on our website.  If you’ve not done so already, be sure to check out our culture video: https://vimeo.com/289302105.  Or if you’re feeling virtual, here’s guided tour of the office in 360 video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7KkzdmSGTM (Warning: not suitable for printers.) You may also enjoy https://www.instagram.com/taoticreative/?hl=en.

Job Summary

It’s one thing to have brilliant ideas and technical knowledge to put together a solution for a client.  But it’s another thing to be able to write it down and articulate it in a way that is clear, concise, and compelling.  That’s your job: to be a driving force behind writing our proposals and submitting them to clients.  Our sales process is extremely collaborative, so it’s not like we throw an RFP at you, lock you in a dark room, and say, “here, write a response to this.”  As our opportunities come in, our team evaluates, qualifies, and strategizes about them.  As a team (of which you will be part), we decide which opportunities to pursue and what our big ideas are.  That’s where you step up.  You borrow bits form old proposals, take ideas from our team, add in your own two cents, and set out to write the world’s best proposal that will get us in the room with the client (metaphorically speaking) to win the work.

Let’s be clear: this is a business development role.  But it’s not your job to go find leads or be the leading voice in pitch meetings (though if you want to do that stuff, there’s definitely a chance to do it).  It will take a while for you to fully get what we do, how we do it, and what makes Taoti special.  A lot of what we do is highly technical, but depending on your comfort level with technical writing, you’ll start to understand what makes us tick. We think a part of being a good proposal writer is getting inside the head of the client. You will need to have calls with them (if they aloe) to determine if we are the right fit and to identify what needs they have. You will also need to research them to understand how to connect their needs to what we propose, creating a proposal that emotionally connects with the client.

Even though we are 100% working remotely right now because of Covid, please note, we are looking for a full time, in-house employee that would have less than a 45-minute commute to our office.

What we're looking for
You write unbelievably well.
You have 4 - 6 years of proposal writing experience in the world of web development, strategic communications, marketing, etc.
You eat 80-page RFPs for breakfast.
You WANT to write proposals.  It’s not a chore.  Not something you have to do as punishment.  Not something you do when you run out of other things.
You are organized.
You can handle the pressure & pace of working in a creative agency.
Tight deadlines don’t scare you.
You have experience selling websites based in WordPress and Drupal.
You like to get focused, and put your head down and write.
You’re not afraid to let some personality show through and know just how much is the right amount of ‘edgy.’
And you know how to adjust the edgy based on audience.
You’re a little bit technical (particularly with regard to web development) and don’t scare easily when faced with jargon you don’t know.
You know Word inside and out.  You’d never dare individually format a heading without applying a style.  You know how to create dynamic TOCs.  You could teach Clippy a thing or three.
While you may not be an artist, you know how to make a fine lookin’ document.
You’re collaborative.  You’re not afraid to get out of your chair and go ask a dev about why a client would want SOLR and how you should position it in the proposal.
You can take your colleague’s lame, 8-page, rambling resume that’s impossible to read and turn it into a beautiful one-pager that makes him or her look like Einstein.
You can work directly with clients to refine and revise proposals, scopes, and other documents.
Is there room for career growth?

That’s one of the best parts about this role, specifically at Taoti.  In a larger shop, the team structure hierarchy is usually large, layered, and not-so-flexible.  Or at a smaller shop, you may have lots of flexibility, but not enough of a team to really benefit from true collaboration (or have enough upward mobility to keep you interested.)  Taoti is the Goldilocks of creative agencies.  We have enough structure so that you understand what the team looks like and where you fit in.  But we’re small and agile enough to let employees carve out new roles and niches where it makes sense to do so.  Your value and career trajectory is not defined by a line or box on an org chart.  Our teams and roles are constantly evolving as the team grows, so if you want to grow into a role that doesn’t exist, you can help create it!  Our growth rate alone (targeted at 50% this year) means that the team will keep growing, which means we’ll be hiring additional people across all departments.  And our hiring philosophy is all about hiring the next wave of employees that best supports the existing team.  In other words, we grow the team around what we already have—not according to some org chart or spreadsheet.  So career paths are not rigid and finite.  We have a history of shaking things up, making rather bold HR moves, and adapting our hiring processes (as well as the roles of our existing employees) in a way that makes strategic sense for the employee and the company. So your career trajectory has far more to do with your own aptitude and initiative than it does with an org chart or who’s above you.  In this particular role, you’re already coming into a new role that will start as just you, grow into a team, then maybe a department, eventually a division, etc.  We don’t have to explain how the idea of being in on the ground floor of a growing agency’s public sector sales department has a lot of potential upside if you’re successful.

What about benefits?
3 weeks PTO for starters.  You gain more with tenure.  And if you’re really big in to PTO, you can even trade back some salary for more.
Telework options (which work like PTO… you accrue days with each paycheck.  TELE days increase with tenure as well.  By your fourth year, we don’t even count them any more.)
100% company-paid medical, dental, and vision insurance.  (50% for qualifying dependents.)  And we have good insurance.
Paid family leave for men and women (including PTO plus short and long term disability options.)
3% retirement plan matching (plus access to a financial advisor).
Home buyer help (including a $1200 closing credit)
Mobile phone reimbursement
You can opt for a company-supplied PC or Mac laptop.  Or if you want to use your own, we’ll reimburse you for it.
Charitable contribution matching
Tax-free metro benefits
A sincere respect of work-life balance
Money and time off allocated for professional development (also increases with tenure)
A diverse team hailing from over 15 countries last time we checked
A very hip/cool/funky/quirky office space on Barracks Row, in the heart of Capitol Hill.  Just 2 blocks from the metro!  (With the office space doubling in size next year as we build a new building in the parking lot next door to our building.)
Fun perks like a roof deck, wine/beer always on tap, regular company boat outings (boat is walking distance from the office), chill work environment, etc.
No real dress code (within reason, as long as you can be an adult about getting dressed for work)
Weekly yoga and meditation classes
Annual global retreat (where we bring the whole team together for fun, games, and teamwork)
Of course, the above is a quick list.  Ask to see the handbook for all the gory details.



What’s the corporate culture like?

Taoti is a pretty casual shop.  You can generally wear whatever you want.  Lots of telework flexibility.  You’ll have access to anyone/everyone in the company, including the CEO.  Not only is it okay to question decisions and policy, but it’s part of your job to do so when you see a better way.  The team is fun and social.  We do a lot in and outside of the office together—from boat trips to happy hours to yoga.  There are all sorts of perks and benefits, but culture isn’t about perks and benefits—it’s about a way of thinking.  And our way of thinking goes back to the mission: to move the needle.  We’re all about doing great work that gets results for our clients.  And everything else that we do here, be it fun or work, in some way drives towards that objective.  (As one employee puts it, “We’re fun, but focused.”  That sums it up pretty well. There are some pictures of the office on the website and our Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/taoticreative/?hl=en.  Always feel free to drop in and see for yourself.

Next steps…

If you’re qualified and interested, please apply on our website (www.taoti.com/careers) and not Indeed or Glassdoor or other such sites (as we cannot respond to those applications.) While we do not have a fixed salary in mind, we're shopping somewhere in the $50-75K range based on experience, seniority, and lots of other factors.  That's just a range--not a hard limit. Also, please know that once the corona virus stuff dies down, this will be an in-house (most of the time) job.

Project Manager (for Web Development Projects),$36K-$76K (Glassdoor est.),"Taoti Creative is looking for a mid- to senior level, strategy-oriented PROJECT MANAGER who knows how to get things done (especially when it comes to developing web sites.)

(Sorry in advance for the long read. But this is your career we’re talking about here! It’s worth the extra detail, right? The right fit is critical for both of our sakes, so please forgive us in advance for the verbosity.)

First, a quick blurb about Taoti…

Established in 1996, Taoti Creative is a boutique, full-service creative agency located on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. We are privately owned and have no corporate overloads (nothing personal, WPP.) We do stuff like web development, social media management, branding, experiential marketing, video, AR/VR, etc. Our mission is to ‘move the needle’ for our clients. We compete (and cooperate) with companies like Huge, Ogilvy, ISL, Chief, ForumOne, etc. We leverage technology, creativity, and innovation to generate meaningful and measurable results for our clients—that’s what drives us. Speaking of clients, they’re about 60% non-profits, 20% commercial, and 20% federal government. Some of our customers include World Bank, USAID, DC Water, Discovery Education, American Chemical Society, Jane Goodall Foundation, and dozens of ‘National Association of _____________,’ etc. Our full time team of about 50 employees is about 65% in-house and 35% remote. We hail from over 12 countries. And for the last three years in a row, we’ve made the Inc5000 list of fastest growing companies in the United States. There’s of course plenty of additional information on our website. If you’ve not done so already, be sure to check out our culture video: https://vimeo.com/289302105. Or if you’re feeling virtual, here’s guided tour of the office in 360 video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7KkzdmSGTM (Warning: not suitable for printers.)

Now, about the job…

Your job, fundamentally, is to be the project leader and use your wits, brains, creativity, innovation, and any resources available to you to produce great projects and happy clients. You’re the project’s champion who makes it happen. Granted, every project has issues. Maybe that new sales guy undersold it. Maybe the dev team spent all their time watching webinars on how to code instead of actually coding. Maybe the client is simply impossible. Whatever the challenges, it’s your job to deal with the curveballs. (Which is not to say that you have to be responsible for fixing all of them. Some things are beyond your control. But as they say: you need the serenity to accept the things you cannot change, the courage to change the things you can, and the wisdom to know the difference.) There is of course all the typical PM stuff… scopes, schedules, budgets, client communications, etc. These are underappreciated, but important parts of the job. But the PM role at Taoti is far more strategic than at most agencies. Our PMs are the project heroes—the people who dig in, call the plays, and then oversee execution. You have a lot of control of the destiny of the project. You have a lot (some would argue too much) autonomy to just figure things out as you see best using our three core principles as your guiding light: Quality, Innovation, Service and Teamwork. You have access to a “QIST Fund” to do stuff that is ‘out of scope’ but helps move the needle for our clients. That is to say, while you do have dedicated designers and strategists on your team, there’s still the smaller, every day decisions that govern how the project go. Those calls are yours to make. And those are critical… like raising a kid, success doesn’t come in big milestone moments with a lot of fanfare. But constant attention, slight corrective actions, and ongoing encouragement—that’s how you succeed.

Please note: we have gotten a LOT of applications from people wanting to 'switch careers' and trying their hand at managing projects. While we understand and respect that, for this particular role, we are looking for with extensive experience managing web development projects.

The challenges of this role…

Taoti puts out creative work that can go head to head with the biggest and best creative agencies in the world. But we’re doing so with a ~50 person team. So we need to be lean, efficient, and leverage our inner scrappiness to get the job done with fewer resources than what some of the big boys would throw at a project. So that often means wearing multiple hats and pitching in with production resources like UX, creative, IA, devs, etc. We’re not saying you have to be creating designs or banging out code. But you will have a lot of direct exposure to a lot of that stuff, and you’ll learn a lot about those trades—to the point where you can start thinking like some of them. And that’s a good thing.

As with any creative company in the business of doing transformative work, another big challenge is balancing our desire to do the best work in the world with the pragmatic realities of project budgets, scope limitations, client deadlines, etc. We actually have something we call a “QIST Fund” to account for it. QIST (Quality, Innovation, Service, and Teamwork) or our four primary guiding lights that we let try to steer our tough decisions. We allocate $250K/year for anyone in the company to utilize to go above and beyond on a project that otherwise doesn’t have the budget to realize some of the more progressive ideas that we have. So we actually encourage getting creative beyond what a budget allow. That being said, it takes an experienced creative to know the difference between ‘cool for the sake of cool’ and strategic risks which have the potential for big client impact. Keeping our heads in the clouds while keeping our feet on the ground is an art form, and it’s how we move the needle as creative professionals.

Is there room for career growth?

That’s one of the best parts about this role, specifically at Taoti. In a larger shop, the project management hierarchy is usually large, layered, and not-so-flexible. Or at a smaller shop, you may have lots of flexibility, but not enough of a team to really benefit from true collaboration. Taoti is the Goldilocks of creative agencies. We have enough structure so that you understand what the team looks like and where you fit in. But we’re small and agile enough to let employees carve out new roles and niches where it makes sense to do so. Our teams and roles are constantly evolving as the team grows, so if you want to grow into a role that doesn’t exist, you can help create it! Our growth rate alone (targeted at 50% this year) means that the team will keep growing, which means we’ll be hiring additional people across all departments. And our hiring philosophy is all about hiring the next wave of employees that best supports the existing team. In other words, we grow the team around what we already have—not according to some org chart or spreadsheet. So career paths are not rigid and finite. We have a history of shaking things up, making rather bold HR moves, and adapting our hiring processes (as well as the roles of our existing employees) in a way that makes strategic sense for the employee and the company. For example, our VP of sales is now in charge of delivery. A previous creative director ended up mostly in sales. And we’ve created all sorts of new roles for new hires for positions that didn’t exist before, in some cases, creating whole new realms within our team structure. The point is that we’re committed to doing whatever makes the most sense and are agile enough to get away with it. So your career trajectory has far more to do with your own aptitude and initiative than it does with an org chart or who’s above you.

Tips for getting onto the short list…
Stand out. When you apply, make an impression.
Even though we’re a full service agency, we do more than our fair share of web development. So experience with Drupal and/or Wordpress is a HUGE plus. If you’ve got it, tell us about it!
Show—don’t tell—us how great you are.
We can tell a lot by the documents someone creates. Doesn’t matter what it is, but we’d love to see some documents you’ve put together.
Talk to us about your favorite tools.
Give us some insight into your general PM philosophies.
Tell us why you want to work at Taoti, specifically. And what was wrong with your last gig that makes you want to leave?
Show us your passion and energy. We like passion and energy.
What’s the corporate culture like?

Taoti is a pretty casual shop. You can generally wear whatever you want. Lots of telework flexibility. You’ll have access to anyone/everyone in the company, including the CEO. Not only is it okay to question decisions and policy, but it’s part of your job to do so when you see a better way. The team is fun and social. We do a lot in and outside of the office together—from boat trips to happy hours to yoga. There are all sorts of perks and benefits, but culture isn’t about perks and benefits—it’s about a way of thinking. And our way of thinking goes back to the mission: to move the needle. We’re all about doing great work that gets results for our clients. And everything else that we do here, be it fun or work, in some way drives towards that objective. (As one employee puts it, “We’re fun, but focused.” That sums it up pretty well. There are some pictures of the office on the website and our Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/taoticreative/?hl=en. Always feel free to drop in and see for yourself.

What about benefits?
3 weeks PTO for starters. You gain more with tenure. And if you’re really big in to PTO, you can even trade back some salary for more.
Telework options (which work like PTO… you accrue days with each paycheck. TELE days increase with tenure as well. By your fourth year, we don’t even count them any more.)
100% company-paid medical, dental, and vision insurance. (50% for qualifying dependents.) And we have good insurance.
Paid family leave for men and women (including PTO plus short and long term disability options.)
3% retirement plan matching (plus access to a financial adviser).
Home buyer help (including a $1200 closing credit)
Mobile phone reimbursement
You can opt for a company-supplied PC or Mac laptop. Or if you want to use your own, we’ll reimburse you for it.
Charitable contribution matching
Guaranteed annual raises
Tax-free metro benefits
A legit 40-hour work week (not 60 hours like some shops essentially require)
Money and time off allocated for professional development (also increases with tenure)
A diverse team hailing from over 15 countries last time we checked
A very hip/cool/funky/quirky office space on Barracks Row, in the heart of Capitol Hill. Just 2 blocks from the metro! (With the office space doubling in size next year as we build a new building in the parking lot next door to our building.)
Fun perks like a roof deck, wine/beer always on tap, regular company boat outings (boat is walking distance from the office), chill work environment, etc.
No real dress code (within reason, as long as you can be an adult about getting dressed for work)
Annual global retreat (where we bring the whole team together for fun, games, and teamwork)
Of course, the above is a quick list. Our handbook covers all the gory details.

Next steps…

If you’re qualified and interested, please apply on our website (www.taoti.com/careers.) Please note that these job ads often get placed onto other websites with their own application systems (we’re looking at you Jooble!) And some sites (looking at you Indeed!) have made up random salary ranges. While we do not have a fixed salary in mind, we're shopping somewhere in the $70-100K range based on experience, seniority, and lots of other factors. That's just a range--not a hard limit. But if you're looking for something well into the 6 figures, we're may not be the right fit and don't want to waste your time. Also, please know that once the corona virus stuff dies down, this will be an in-house (most of the time) job. If you don't live in the DC area now but plan to relocate, please make sure you indicate as such somewhere in your application. Otherwise, we're likely to reject because we assume you aren't in our area. We aren't able to respond to applications that don’t come through our own website (Because we use software to manage our hiring process, and without it, it would be the wild west here. So please be sure you’re applying on our website.)

Samaritan's Purse Statement of Faith:

* We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God. (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17)

* We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; Ephesians 4:4-6)

* We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood on the cross, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. (Matthew 1:23; John 1:1-4 and 1:29; Acts 1:11 and 2:22-24; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 1:1-4 and 4:15)

* We believe that all men everywhere are lost and face the judgment of God, that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation, and that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ results in regeneration by the Holy Spirit. (Luke 24:46-47; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:23; 2 Corinthians 5:10-11; Ephesians 1:7 and 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7)

* We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, whose indwelling enables the Christian to live a godly life. (John 3:5-8; Acts 1:8 and 4:31; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Galatians 5:16-18; Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 2:6-10)

* We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto the resurrection of eternal life and the lost unto the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment. (1 Corinthians 15:51-57; Revelation 20:11-15)

* We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the church. (1 Corinthians 12:12, 27; Ephesians 1:22-23)

* We believe that the ministry of evangelism and discipleship is a responsibility of all followers of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15; 1 Peter 3:15)

* We believe Gods plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as unique biological persons made to complete each other. God instituted monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female. (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5-6; Mark 10:6-9; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9)

* We believe that we must dedicate ourselves to prayer, to the service of our Lord, to His authority over our lives, and to the ministry of evangelism. (Matthew 9:35-38; 22:37-39, and 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15 and 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10; Colossians 2:6-10; 1 Peter 3:15)

* We believe that human life is sacred from conception to its natural end; and that we must have concern for the physical and spiritual needs of our fellowmen. (Psalm 139:13; Isaiah 49:1; Jeremiah 1:5; Matthew 22:37-39; Romans 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10)

Event Producer & Community Architect // BOSTON,$26K-$48K (Glassdoor est.),"Hello friend. We are Daybreaker, a community of early risers whose mission is to stitch the world back together through dance, self-expression, music and mischief. We are a team of Community Architects, Experience Designers, Artists, Performers, and Mischief Makers — and we create experiences IRL so that we can get back to connecting with one another through all five of our senses, not just two (our phones) — and in the morning when our bodies are the most energetic and awake. With the isolation epidemic our most pressing global problem — that bleeds into every aspect of humanity (when we don't belong, we don't care about the environment, animals, we lack empathy etc.) — we are solving this problem with the most POTENT solution: DANCE. When we bring movement, music, fun, aliveness, play and dance into the conversation, all of a sudden, eradicating isolation begins to feel achievable. Daybreaker is now in 27 cities with a community of 500K+ activated members who wake up at sunrise to dance with reckless abandon, all without substances.

And now, we are launching in BOSTON and are looking for YOU — the most passionate, creative, curious, and service oriented Community Architect and Experience Designer who is as excited as we are to level their city up and create a space for all ages, all shapes, all genders and sexual orientations to come together, connect and dance.

Daybreaker is a 3-hour experience, typically from 6am to 9am where the first hour is yoga or fitness and the next two hours is a full-on, immersive, performative dance party. Imagine seeing breakdancers, aerialists, fire spinners and dueling violinists — all before going to work.

A few words from our community:

—

""Daybreaker is a SPIRITUAL experience. It's the first dance floor I've truly let go on and have felt years of trauma leave my body. Dancing is medicine and I never understood that until I went to Daybreaker. Thank you for creating such an inclusive, substance-free judgement-free space. I never miss one now.""

""I didn't realize how co-dependent having fun and drinking was for me until I went to Daybreaker and had the best morning of my life, completely sober!

""Dancing is truly the BEST way to stay healthy and active! I probably burn 1000 calories at Daybreaker! I forgot that ""working out"" could actually be FUN!""

""I met my now best friend on the dance floor. We made eye contact on the dance floor, smiled and twirled each other around! It took real courage for me since I usually only get wild when I'm on something. It was SO freeing to meet someone AS ME. Thank you Daybreaker!""

""Daybreaker inspired me to come out to my family. After feeling so included and so free, I had the courage to share with my family who I really am. Thank you for changing my life in such a pivotal way.""

—

This is a critical moment for humanity. We can go in two directions — into a VR headset or into our most present human experience. It's time to shed all the layers and get back to dance. We believe dance is the antidote. Let's make magic.

Senior Back End Drupal Developer (Must be US Citizen),$38K-$76K (Glassdoor est.),"Taoti Creative is looking a senior level, back-end, Drupal developer (US Citizens ONLY)

For this role, we are open to in-house, remote, full time, and contractor status. Basically, we're open to anything, SO LONG AS YOU ARE A US CITIZEN because we need you to work on some projects that have that requirement.

(Sorry in advance for the long read. But this is your career we’re talking about here! It’s worth the extra detail, right? The right fit is critical for both of our sakes, so please forgive us in advance for the verbosity.)

First, a quick blurb about Taoti…

Established in 1996, Taoti Creative is a boutique, full-service creative agency located on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. We are privately owned and have no corporate overloads (nothing personal, WPP.) We do stuff like web development, social media management, branding, experiential marketing, video, AR/VR, etc. Our mission is to ‘move the needle’ for our clients. We compete (and cooperate) with companies like Huge, Ogilvy, ISL, Chief, ForumOne, etc. We leverage technology, creativity, and innovation to generate meaningful and measurable results for our clients—that’s what drives us. Speaking of clients, they’re about 60% non-profits, 20% commercial, and 20% federal government. Some of our customers include World Bank, USAID, DC Water, Discovery Education, American Chemical Society, Jane Goodall Foundation, and dozens of ‘National Association of _____________,’ etc. Our full time team of about 50 employees is about 65% in-house and 35% remote. We hail from over 12 countries. And for the last three years in a row, we’ve made the Inc5000 list of fastest growing companies in the United States. There’s of course plenty of additional information on our website. If you’ve not done so already, be sure to check out our culture video: https://vimeo.com/289302105. Or if you’re feeling virtual, here’s guided tour of the office in 360 video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7KkzdmSGTM (Warning: not suitable for printers.)

Things you'll do on the job:
Lead the technical planning, user story and technical acceptance creation, and coding.
Guide and manage other developers that are contributing code to the project.
Estimate the level of development tasks within a project.
Identify and correct complex bugs and problems.
Plan technical architectures that minimize or eliminate performance problems, complexity, or solution fragility.
Work independently or with limited oversight to create high quality applications that meet specifications.
Serve as the technical lead in a client-facing capacity on medium and large-sized projects.
Write custom modules for Drupal..
Build web sites and applications by writing object-oriented PHP and configuring and extending content management software (Drupal).
Assess existing sites/systems for code quality and interactive appeal.
Evangelize for best practices for open source development.
The challenges of this role…

Like any dev role, balancing timelines, budgets, requirements, and customer happiness is always a challenge. Because this is a senior level role, we generally expect you to be able to get up to speed quickly and be self-sufficient for the most part. You’ll be working in a team of 3-6 other developers under a Technical Manager that helps your team deliver its work. At any given time, you may be working on several projects at the same day, so jumping back and forth between projects is always a challenge in an agency environment, but we try hard to let developers focus more time on fewer projects when we can, as we understand that’s how we become more efficient as a group.

What it’s like to be a remote developer at Taoti

Many companies hire remote developers and treat them like code monkeys that they pay to deliver code. Taoti is different. Taoti wants to hire you as part of our in-house team. And while you may not technically be under our office roof, you’re as much a part of the team as those who are. We’ll sing happy birthday to you over video chat, fly you to DC for company retreats, and communicate (usually via Slack) all day long with you. Better yet, you get many of the benefits that we offer the rest of our employees, like paid time off and holidays (and if you’re in the United States, health insurance, retirement account contributions, etc.) You’ll get a fixed monthly salary, regardless of how many hours you work, even if we have nothing for you to do (but that won’t be an issue—we always have work to do.) You may be technically be a subcontractor to us, but we’ll treat you like an in-house employee. And we want you to treat us the same way! (Note: Taoti has about 50 employees. About 20 of them are developers. And of those 20, more than half are spread throughout South, Central, and North America. Most of the non-developer staff is based out of our DC office, so we have a unique culture in that regard, but it works well.

Tips for getting onto the short list…

First, you have to be a senior level developer and have the experience and code to show us that you really know what you’re doing. There will be several interviews and code reviews. It’s important that you’re a good cultural fit in addition to being an excellent coder. We want to know that you will work well with in a team both technically and socially. It isn't just about the code for us. Your personality and contribution to our culture are important to us as well. Finally, because we value communication and collaboration so highly, great English is a must. It's the reason we are only considering the Americas and not India or Europe. There are great devs there too, but we want people who are awake when we are and can work with us in real time.

What’s the corporate culture like?

We have a great culture (in fact, we've won several awards for being so cool! ;-) We're a pretty casual shop. You can generally wear whatever you want. Lots of telework flexibility. You’ll have access to anyone/everyone in the company, including the CEO. Not only is it okay to question decisions and policy, but it’s part of your job to do so when you see a better way. The team is fun and social. We do a lot in and outside of the office together—from boat trips to happy hours to roof yoga. There are all sorts of perks and benefits, but culture isn’t about perks and benefits—it’s about a way of thinking. And our way of thinking goes back to the mission: to move the needle. We’re all about doing great work that gets meaningful and measurable results for our clients. And everything else that we do here, be it fun or work, in some way drives towards that objective. (As one employee puts it, “We’re fun, but focused.” That sums it up pretty well. There are some pictures of the office on the website and our Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/taoticreative/?hl=en. Always feel free to drop in and see for yourself.

What about benefits?

(Note: the below are benefits for in-house, W2 employees. If you are remote, you generally get most of these benefits, but there are a few differences for logistic and legal reasons.)
3 weeks PTO for starters. You gain more with tenure. And if you’re really big in to PTO, you can even trade back some salary for more.
Telework options (which work like PTO… you accrue days with each paycheck. TELE days increase with tenure as well. By your fourth year, we don’t even count them any more.)
100% company-paid medical, dental, and vision insurance. (50% for qualifying dependents.) And we have good insurance.
Paid family leave for men and women (including PTO plus short and long term disability options.)
3% retirement plan matching (plus access to a financial advisor).
Home buyer help (including a $1200 closing credit)
Mobile phone reimbursement
You can opt for a company-supplied PC or Mac laptop. Or if you want to use your own, we’ll reimburse you for it.

We are a team of Community Architects, Experience Designers, Artists, Performers, and Mischief Makers — and we create experiences IRL so that we can get back to connecting with one another through all five of our senses, not just two (our phones) — and in the morning when our bodies are the most energetic and awake. With the isolation epidemic our most pressing global problem — that bleeds into every aspect of humanity (when we don't belong, we don't care about the environment, animals, we lack empathy etc.) — we are solving this problem with the most POTENT solution: DANCE. When we bring movement, music, fun, aliveness, play and dance into the conversation, all of a sudden, eradicating isolation begins to feel achievable. Daybreaker is now in 27 cities with a community of 500K+ activated members who wake up at sunrise to dance with reckless abandon, all without substances.

And now, we are launching in BOSTON and are looking for YOU — the most passionate, creative, curious, and service oriented Community Architect and Experience Designer who is as excited as we are to level their city up and create a space for all ages, all shapes, all genders and sexual orientations to come together, connect and dance.

Daybreaker is a 3-hour experience, typically from 6am to 9am where the first hour is yoga or fitness and the next two hours is a full-on, immersive, performative dance party. Imagine seeing breakdancers, aerialists, fire spinners and dueling violinists — all before going to work.

A few words from our community:

—

""Daybreaker is a SPIRITUAL experience. It's the first dance floor I've truly let go on and have felt years of trauma leave my body. Dancing is medicine and I never understood that until I went to Daybreaker. Thank you for creating such an inclusive, substance-free judgement-free space. I never miss one now.""

""I didn't realize how co-dependent having fun and drinking was for me until I went to Daybreaker and had the best morning of my life, completely sober!

""Dancing is truly the BEST way to stay healthy and active! I probably burn 1000 calories at Daybreaker! I forgot that ""working out"" could actually be FUN!""

""I met my now best friend on the dance floor. We made eye contact on the dance floor, smiled and twirled each other around! It took real courage for me since I usually only get wild when I'm on something. It was SO freeing to meet someone AS ME. Thank you Daybreaker!""

""Daybreaker inspired me to come out to my family. After feeling so included and so free, I had the courage to share with my family who I really am. Thank you for changing my life in such a pivotal way.""

—

This is a critical moment for humanity. We can go in two directions — into a VR headset or into our most present human experience. It's time to shed all the layers and get back to dance. We believe dance is the antidote. Let's make magic.

Group Account Director,$45K-$60K (Glassdoor est.),"Mirrorball is on the hunt for an experienced Group Account Director. As a thought leader, you will play an integral role in strategically guiding all agency activity to support client objectives while maintaining our well respected creative aesthetic. You are a dynamic team player who brings confidence and comfort to our clients as well as inspiration and leadership to the agency’s client service team. You will report into our VP of Client Services and Cultural Insights, working closely with her to mentor and develop our Client Services team while managing your own designated client relationships.

You’re a courageous and visionary client leader!
As a perpetual student of our clients’ industries, you possess a deep understanding of each client’s business and objectives. You are known for driving progressive approaches, concepts, and solutions that anticipate a client’s needs. You are a master at proactively identifying white space opportunities, whether it’s through investigative detective work or gut intuition backed by insights. Just as importantly, you are also able to teach this critical skill to your team.

You are always looking for ways to develop and strengthen relationships within the client organization and with agency partners. You understand the only way to be successful and grow the business is to build trust and evolve these relationships at all levels. You have a unique point of view. Clients and teammates enjoy working with you because you are positive, down to earth, efficient and always willing to go above and beyond whatever is needed.

Your experience speaks volumes, and everyone stops to listen when you talk. You are a great storyteller and have a unique ability to use relevant metaphors and cultural references to get across a particular point of view. As important as what you say--you are also inquisitive and curious. You have an innate ability to connect the dots when others struggle. Your clients admire and respect you because you are down to earth and because you will always have a reasonable solution to the toughest challenge.

At Mirrorball we work hard and play hard. We are on a constant mission to understand and predict the rapid evolution of popular culture. We love experiencing new things and sharing it with our clients and colleagues. We invest heavily in hospitality not only to have fun but to also educate our clients on what's next--you take joy in planning that next client outing that not only entertains but also informs.

You're a respected team member & collaborator!
You understand that kindly and effectively managing up is as important as managing down. You lead by example as a hard worker who is willing to get in the trenches with the troops. You earn respect not only because of your work ethic, experience, and strengths but because you demonstrate empathy and respect for others. Your patience and understanding as an active listener insure that your clients, team members, and others are in tune with the big picture as well as every detail.

You’re a smooth operator!
You can evaluate the feasibility of complex programs or campaigns and help steer the ship towards success. You have an amazing ability to bring people together to work for a common goal. You have been around the block and know “good” from “great,” and you always strive to deliver at the highest level of creative excellence, production, and client service possible.

You’re a delegation master with magical octopus arms!
You thrive as a multi-tasker with a high degree of organization and poise. As a great team leader, you can oversee multiple projects at the same time, keeping our creative and production teams as stress-free as possible, all while maintaining a tight focus on creating an outstanding experience for our clients. Whatever is going on behind the scenes, you always remain cool, calm, and collected.

You can herd cats!
You know how to rally departments and individuals that contribute to the success of a program, and you have an amazing ability to bring people together to work for a common goal. You always strive to deliver at the highest level of creative excellence, production, and client service possible.

As a part of a creative-centric agency, you help seamlessly navigate the treacherous waters of giving the creative team plenty of latitude to create, while making sure the client’s objectives are being met AND keeping everything on time and on budget (easy, right?!). You have a deep respect for the creative process and are willing to go the extra mile to help convince a client to leave their comfort zone. You understand the tension between creative excellence and client complacency. You will always help find the right balance to keep everyone invested and moving forward to create and execute effective and award-winning ideas.

You’re a talent building master!
You’ve had great mentors (and have learned from the not-so-great) and love being one yourself. Spotting talent and encouraging the growth of team members is part of what gets you geeked about coming to work. Your team looks to you for inspiration and guidance, and you have the emotional intelligence to appropriately and effectively deliver praise as well as constructive criticism.

You love details, details, details!
You might be a Virgo or just super type-A, but everything from basic correspondence to epic budget sheets and reconciliations are no match for your laser-sharp attention to detail. You have experience drafting clear, accurate proposals and project scopes, and you communicate as well via email as you do verbally.

Speaking of details… here are some more DETAILS:
This role is best suited for someone who fits the above description and possesses considerable experiential marketing experience. Exceptions are happily made for the right cultural fit and passionate candidate! Extra credit given for those with quick wit and a stellar sense of humor.

The challenges of this role…

Like any dev role, balancing timelines, budgets, requirements, and customer happiness is always a challenge. Because this is a senior level role, we generally expect you to be able to get up to speed quickly and be self-sufficient for the most part. You’ll be working in a team of 3-6 other developers under a Technical Manager that helps your team deliver its work. At any given time, you may be working on several projects at the same day, so jumping back and forth between projects is always a challenge in an agency environment, but we try hard to let developers focus more time on fewer projects when we can, as we understand that’s how we become more efficient as a group.

What it’s like to be a remote developer at Taoti

Many companies hire remote developers and treat them like code monkeys that they pay to deliver code. Taoti is different. Taoti wants to hire you as part of our in-house team. And while you may not technically be under our office roof, you’re as much a part of the team as those who are. We’ll sing happy birthday to you over video chat, fly you to DC for company retreats, and communicate (usually via Slack) all day long with you. Better yet, you get many of the benefits that we offer the rest of our employees, like paid time off and holidays (and if you’re in the United States, health insurance, retirement account contributions, etc.) You’ll get a fixed monthly salary, regardless of how many hours you work, even if we have nothing for you to do (but that won’t be an issue—we always have work to do.) You may be technically be a subcontractor to us, but we’ll treat you like an in-house employee. And we want you to treat us the same way! (Note: Taoti has about 50 employees. About 20 of them are developers. And of those 20, more than half are spread throughout South, Central, and North America. Most of the non-developer staff is based out of our DC office, so we have a unique culture in that regard, but it works well.

Tips for getting onto the short list…

First, you have to be a senior level developer and have the experience and code to show us that you really know what you’re doing. There will be several interviews and code reviews. It’s important that you’re a good cultural fit in addition to being an excellent coder. We want to know that you will work well with in a team both technically and socially. It isn't just about the code for us. Your personality and contribution to our culture are important to us as well. Finally, because we value communication and collaboration so highly, great English is a must. It's the reason we are only considering the Americas and not India or Europe. There are great devs there too, but we want people who are awake when we are and can work with us in real time.

What’s the corporate culture like?

We have a great culture (in fact, we've won several awards for being so cool! ;-) We're a pretty casual shop. You can generally wear whatever you want. Lots of telework flexibility. You’ll have access to anyone/everyone in the company, including the CEO. Not only is it okay to question decisions and policy, but it’s part of your job to do so when you see a better way. The team is fun and social. We do a lot in and outside of the office together—from boat trips to happy hours to roof yoga. There are all sorts of perks and benefits, but culture isn’t about perks and benefits—it’s about a way of thinking. And our way of thinking goes back to the mission: to move the needle. We’re all about doing great work that gets meaningful and measurable results for our clients. And everything else that we do here, be it fun or work, in some way drives towards that objective. (As one employee puts it, “We’re fun, but focused.” That sums it up pretty well. There are some pictures of the office on the website and our Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/taoticreative/?hl=en. Always feel free to drop in and see for yourself.

What about benefits?

(Note: the below are benefits for in-house, W2 employees. If you are remote, you generally get most of these benefits, but there are a few differences for logistic and legal reasons.)
3 weeks PTO for starters. You gain more with tenure. And if you’re really big in to PTO, you can even trade back some salary for more.
Telework options (which work like PTO… you accrue days with each paycheck. TELE days increase with tenure as well. By your fourth year, we don’t even count them any more.)
100% company-paid medical, dental, and vision insurance. (50% for qualifying dependents.) And we have good insurance.
Paid family leave for men and women (including PTO plus short and long term disability options.)
3% retirement plan matching (plus access to a financial advisor).
Home buyer help (including a $1200 closing credit)
Mobile phone reimbursement
You can opt for a company-supplied PC or Mac laptop. Or if you want to use your own, we’ll reimburse you for it.
Charitable contribution matching
Guaranteed annual raises
Tax-free metro benefits
A legit 40-hour work week (not 60 hours like some shops essentially require)
Weekly, in-office Yoga and Meditation sessions
Money and time off allocated for professional development (also increases with tenure)
A diverse team hailing from over 15 countries last time we checked
A very hip/cool/funky/quirky office space on Barracks Row, in the heart of Capitol Hill. Just 2 blocks from the metro! (With the office space doubling in size next year as we build a new building in the parking lot next door to our building.)
Fun perks like a roof deck, wine/beer always on tap, regular company boat outings (boat is walking distance from the office), chill work environment, etc.
No real dress code (within reason, as long as you can be an adult about getting dressed for work)
Weekly yoga and meditation classes
Annual global retreat (where we bring the whole team together for fun, games, and teamwork)
Of course, the above is a quick list. See the handbook for all the gory details.

Daybreaker is a 3-hour experience, typically from 6am to 9am where the first hour is yoga or fitness and the next two hours is a full-on, immersive, performative dance party. Imagine seeing breakdancers, aerialists, fire spinners and dueling violinists — all before going to work.

A few words from our community:

—

""Daybreaker is a SPIRITUAL experience. It's the first dance floor I've truly let go on and have felt years of trauma leave my body. Dancing is medicine and I never understood that until I went to Daybreaker. Thank you for creating such an inclusive, substance-free judgement-free space. I never miss one now.""

""I didn't realize how co-dependent having fun and drinking was for me until I went to Daybreaker and had the best morning of my life, completely sober!

""Dancing is truly the BEST way to stay healthy and active! I probably burn 1000 calories at Daybreaker! I forgot that ""working out"" could actually be FUN!""

""I met my now best friend on the dance floor. We made eye contact on the dance floor, smiled and twirled each other around! It took real courage for me since I usually only get wild when I'm on something. It was SO freeing to meet someone AS ME. Thank you Daybreaker!""

""Daybreaker inspired me to come out to my family. After feeling so included and so free, I had the courage to share with my family who I really am. Thank you for changing my life in such a pivotal way.""

—

This is a critical moment for humanity. We can go in two directions — into a VR headset or into our most present human experience. It's time to shed all the layers and get back to dance. We believe dance is the antidote. Let's make magic.

Lead Developer,$21K-$41K (Glassdoor est.),"What is nok?

nok is an invite-only marketplace to try high-end products from home for free! Our tryouts include same-day delivery, $0 down and return pickup.

Our circular supply chain and proprietary infrastructure allows us to quickly turn around returns of these items at the end of the tryouts so they can be sent to the next customer (in less than 48 hours) greatly reducing the need for costly returns in eCommerce.

nok doubles up as an experiential marketing channel for brands resulting in authentic product experiences, user-generated content, word of mouth and ultimately more sales.

We have been providing our service as white-label for major brands like Samsonite, TUMI and Lavazza but always wanted to build our own marketplace. COVID19 accelerated our decision and this is now our sole focus!

We're backed by Greycroft (same backers as Bird, Acorns, Goop, Bumble, etc.), Moonshots and Village Global and more importantly aim to surround ourselves with the best talent to re-imagine how people shop.

We offer generous health benefits, 401K plans, and other incentives to stay fit and healthy - let's get nokking!

Your role

As one of the early developers at Nok you will be leading the technical architecture, best practices, and implementation of revolutionary greenfield projects to enable our proprietary consumer trial and reverse logistics platform. You’ll be working closely with our advisor, Dana Peele, a Director of Engineering at Grubhub with extensive experience in distributed systems and high-throughput cloud applications. The software you design and build will enable Nok’s expansion for years to come and scale as we onboard our extensive backlog of consumer brands.

We’re looking for highly experienced developers with React expertise, full-stack knowledge, and AWS know-how. And although we’re focusing on TypeScript on the front and back ends, React, and AWS PaaS offerings, nothing is set in stone and your opinions, experience, and research will influence system design decisions.

The successful candidate will have a strong focus on operational excellence, particularly testing, CI / CD automation, documentation, internal tooling, and monitoring and alerting, and be self sufficient, and able to hit the ground running. They’ll be avid readers and learners, up to date with the latest frameworks, practices, technologies, and design patterns.

The team is truly focused on building a best in class platform- we won’t be rushing to get something out the door and business, product, and tech are in alignment on maintaining the highest standards. That said, we also value simplicity and pragmatism- best practice doesn’t mean infinitely scalable or complex.

The short term product roadmap is focused on producing our consumer facing ecommerce site to enable trial sign up by our users while the team gathers data on our reverse logistics to identify pain points and properly prioritize longer term software needs.
In addition to your work as an IC, you’ll also provide mentorship to more junior devs and assist with technical blog posts and other evangelism, hiring, and interfacing with product and business at the highest level.

Come join our team and build the tech that will enable the continued success of our business and company!
Suggested Requirements:
Bachelor’s Degree in the Sciences, Mathematics, Programming, or Engineering related fields
5+ years experience building highly-scalable applications
3+ years in a leadership capacity
Experience with eCommerce and / or logistics systems
Ability to lead a team of engineers while providing mentorship and coaching to further career growth and development
Extensive experience with TypeScript (preferred) or JavaScript
Experience with Node, React, and other modern JavaScript frameworks
Experience architecting, designing, and developing testable, fault-tolerant, and performant software
AWS experience or experience with similar cloud-based offerings
Experience with AWS Platform-as-a-Service and Function-as-a-Service offerings including but not limited to: AppSync, Cognito, DynamoDB, S3, and Lambda preferred
Automated integration and unit testing experience
Familiarity with distributed databases and / or relational / document databases is desired
Familiarity or experience with Docker or similar containerized solutions
Closing points

In our view, happy and driven people are the secret sauce to a successful company, and at nok, we value building the right team of dreamers above all else. In order to maintain happy people, we understand the importance of physical and emotional health, and have created a culture to support the well being of our team. The nature of an early stage startup can be quite demanding at times, but we believe the right group of people with the right mindset can achieve the seemingly impossible together.

Lead Developer,$21K-$41K (Glassdoor est.),"What is nok?

nok is an invite-only marketplace to try high-end products from home for free! Our tryouts include same-day delivery, $0 down and return pickup.

Our circular supply chain and proprietary infrastructure allows us to quickly turn around returns of these items at the end of the tryouts so they can be sent to the next customer (in less than 48 hours) greatly reducing the need for costly returns in eCommerce.

nok doubles up as an experiential marketing channel for brands resulting in authentic product experiences, user-generated content, word of mouth and ultimately more sales.

We have been providing our service as white-label for major brands like Samsonite, TUMI and Lavazza but always wanted to build our own marketplace. COVID19 accelerated our decision and this is now our sole focus!

We're backed by Greycroft (same backers as Bird, Acorns, Goop, Bumble, etc.), Moonshots and Village Global and more importantly aim to surround ourselves with the best talent to re-imagine how people shop.

We offer generous health benefits, 401K plans, and other incentives to stay fit and healthy - let's get nokking!

Your role

As one of the early developers at Nok you will be leading the technical architecture, best practices, and implementation of revolutionary greenfield projects to enable our proprietary consumer trial and reverse logistics platform. You’ll be working closely with our advisor, Dana Peele, a Director of Engineering at Grubhub with extensive experience in distributed systems and high-throughput cloud applications. The software you design and build will enable Nok’s expansion for years to come and scale as we onboard our extensive backlog of consumer brands.

We’re looking for highly experienced developers with React expertise, full-stack knowledge, and AWS know-how. And although we’re focusing on TypeScript on the front and back ends, React, and AWS PaaS offerings, nothing is set in stone and your opinions, experience, and research will influence system design decisions.

The successful candidate will have a strong focus on operational excellence, particularly testing, CI / CD automation, documentation, internal tooling, and monitoring and alerting, and be self sufficient, and able to hit the ground running. They’ll be avid readers and learners, up to date with the latest frameworks, practices, technologies, and design patterns.

The team is truly focused on building a best in class platform- we won’t be rushing to get something out the door and business, product, and tech are in alignment on maintaining the highest standards. That said, we also value simplicity and pragmatism- best practice doesn’t mean infinitely scalable or complex.

The short term product roadmap is focused on producing our consumer facing ecommerce site to enable trial sign up by our users while the team gathers data on our reverse logistics to identify pain points and properly prioritize longer term software needs.
In addition to your work as an IC, you’ll also provide mentorship to more junior devs and assist with technical blog posts and other evangelism, hiring, and interfacing with product and business at the highest level.

Come join our team and build the tech that will enable the continued success of our business and company!
Suggested Requirements:
Bachelor’s Degree in the Sciences, Mathematics, Programming, or Engineering related fields
5+ years experience building highly-scalable applications
3+ years in a leadership capacity
Experience with eCommerce and / or logistics systems
Ability to lead a team of engineers while providing mentorship and coaching to further career growth and development
Extensive experience with TypeScript (preferred) or JavaScript
Experience with Node, React, and other modern JavaScript frameworks
Experience architecting, designing, and developing testable, fault-tolerant, and performant software
AWS experience or experience with similar cloud-based offerings
Experience with AWS Platform-as-a-Service and Function-as-a-Service offerings including but not limited to: AppSync, Cognito, DynamoDB, S3, and Lambda preferred
Automated integration and unit testing experience
Familiarity with distributed databases and / or relational / document databases is desired
Familiarity or experience with Docker or similar containerized solutions
Closing points

In our view, happy and driven people are the secret sauce to a successful company, and at nok, we value building the right team of dreamers above all else. In order to maintain happy people, we understand the importance of physical and emotional health, and have created a culture to support the well being of our team. The nature of an early stage startup can be quite demanding at times, but we believe the right group of people with the right mindset can achieve the seemingly impossible together.

nok is an invite-only marketplace to try high-end products from home for free! Our tryouts include same-day delivery, $0 down and return pickup.

Our circular supply chain and proprietary infrastructure allows us to quickly turn around returns of these items at the end of the tryouts so they can be sent to the next customer (in less than 48 hours) greatly reducing the need for costly returns in eCommerce.

nok doubles up as an experiential marketing channel for brands resulting in authentic product experiences, user-generated content, word of mouth and ultimately more sales.

We have been providing our service as white-label for major brands like Samsonite, TUMI and Lavazza but always wanted to build our own marketplace. COVID19 accelerated our decision and this is now our sole focus!

We're backed by Greycroft (same backers as Bird, Acorns, Goop, Bumble, etc.), Moonshots and Village Global and more importantly aim to surround ourselves with the best talent to re-imagine how people shop.

We offer generous health benefits, 401K plans, and other incentives to stay fit and healthy - let's get nokking!

You’ll be working closely with our advisor, Dana Peele, a Director of Engineering at Grubhub with extensive experience in distributed systems and high-throughput cloud applications.

Lead Developer,$21K-$41K (Glassdoor est.),"What is nok?

nok is an invite-only marketplace to try high-end products from home for free! Our tryouts include same-day delivery, $0 down and return pickup.

Our circular supply chain and proprietary infrastructure allows us to quickly turn around returns of these items at the end of the tryouts so they can be sent to the next customer (in less than 48 hours) greatly reducing the need for costly returns in eCommerce.

nok doubles up as an experiential marketing channel for brands resulting in authentic product experiences, user-generated content, word of mouth and ultimately more sales.

We have been providing our service as white-label for major brands like Samsonite, TUMI and Lavazza but always wanted to build our own marketplace. COVID19 accelerated our decision and this is now our sole focus!

We're backed by Greycroft (same backers as Bird, Acorns, Goop, Bumble, etc.), Moonshots and Village Global and more importantly aim to surround ourselves with the best talent to re-imagine how people shop.

We offer generous health benefits, 401K plans, and other incentives to stay fit and healthy - let's get nokking!

Your role

As one of the early developers at Nok you will be leading the technical architecture, best practices, and implementation of revolutionary greenfield projects to enable our proprietary consumer trial and reverse logistics platform. You’ll be working closely with our advisor, Dana Peele, a Director of Engineering at Grubhub with extensive experience in distributed systems and high-throughput cloud applications. The software you design and build will enable Nok’s expansion for years to come and scale as we onboard our extensive backlog of consumer brands.

We’re looking for highly experienced developers with React expertise, full-stack knowledge, and AWS know-how. And although we’re focusing on TypeScript on the front and back ends, React, and AWS PaaS offerings, nothing is set in stone and your opinions, experience, and research will influence system design decisions.

The successful candidate will have a strong focus on operational excellence, particularly testing, CI / CD automation, documentation, internal tooling, and monitoring and alerting, and be self sufficient, and able to hit the ground running. They’ll be avid readers and learners, up to date with the latest frameworks, practices, technologies, and design patterns.

The team is truly focused on building a best in class platform- we won’t be rushing to get something out the door and business, product, and tech are in alignment on maintaining the highest standards. That said, we also value simplicity and pragmatism- best practice doesn’t mean infinitely scalable or complex.

The short term product roadmap is focused on producing our consumer facing ecommerce site to enable trial sign up by our users while the team gathers data on our reverse logistics to identify pain points and properly prioritize longer term software needs.
In addition to your work as an IC, you’ll also provide mentorship to more junior devs and assist with technical blog posts and other evangelism, hiring, and interfacing with product and business at the highest level.

Come join our team and build the tech that will enable the continued success of our business and company!
Suggested Requirements:
Bachelor’s Degree in the Sciences, Mathematics, Programming, or Engineering related fields
5+ years experience building highly-scalable applications
